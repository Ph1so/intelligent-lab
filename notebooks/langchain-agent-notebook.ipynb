    "Basics on agents\n",
    "* In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. This is different from langchain \"chains\" where the steps taken are hardcoded. \n",
    "* Agents work with tools. You can define various tools like websearch or RAG which the agent can then call.\n",
    "* In langchain, you create an agent like `from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent`, however the agent doesn't execute those steps; that's done by `AgentExecutor`.\n",
    "* By default, agents don't have access to chat history, but this can be setup. "

Accessing Wells in Labware Well Ordering You need to select which wells to transfer liquids to and from over the course of a protocol.

Location arguments of pipetting commands use the primary channel. The InstrumentContext.configure_nozzle_layout() method can change the pipette’s primary channel, using its start parameter.

The pipette will dispense liquid into all the wells simultaneously. 8-Channel, 384-Well Plate Example In general, you should specify wells in the first row of a well plate when using multi-channel pipettes. An exception to this rule is when using 384-well plates. The greater well density means the nozzles of a multi-channel pipette can only access every other well in a column.

Pipette Flow Rates Measured in µL/s, the flow rate determines how much liquid a pipette can aspirate, dispense, and blow out. Opentrons pipettes have their own default flow rates.

For example, say you need to move 100 µL of liquid from one well to another, but you only have a 50 µL pipette attached to your robot.

This includes when tip refilling requires multiple aspirations from a single source well. distribute() and consolidate() only pick up one tip, even when new_tip=\"always\". For example, this distribute command returns to the source well a second time, because the amount to be distributed (400 µL total plus disposal volume) exceeds the pipette capacity (300 μ L): pipette.distribute( volume=200, source=plate[\"A1\"], dest=[plate[\"B1\"], plate[\"B2\"]], new_tip=\"always\", ) But it does not pick up a new tip after dispensing into B1: Picking up tip from A1 of tip rack on 3 Aspirating 220.0 uL from A1 of well plate on 2 at 92.86 uL/sec Dispensing 200.0 uL into B1 of well plate on 2 at'),\n",

For example: # get the location at the center of well A1 center_location = plate[\"A1\"].center() # get a location 1 mm right, 1 mm back, and 1 mm up from the center of well A1 adjusted_location = center_location.move(types.Point(x=1, y=1, z=1)) # aspirate 1 mm right, 1 mm back, and 1 mm up from the center of well A1 pipette.aspirate(50, adjusted_location)'),\n",

You still need to use move() to adjust these positions along the x- or y-axis: # the following are equivalent pipette.move_to(plate[\"A1\"].bottom(z=2)) pipette.move_to(plate[\"A1\"].bottom().move(types.Point(z=2))) # adjust along the y-axis pipette.move_to(plate[\"A1\"].bottom().move(types.Point(y=2))) New in version 2.0. Movement Speeds In addition to instructing the robot where to move a pipette, you can also control the speed at which it moves. Speed controls can be applied either to all pipette motions or to movement along a particular axis. Gantry Speed The robot’s gantry usually moves as fast as it can given its construction. The default speed for Flex varies between 300 and 350 mm/s. The OT-2 default is 400'),\n",

Advanced control As its name implies, the Python Protocol API is primarily designed for creating protocols that you upload via the Opentrons App and execute on the robot as a unit.

Create a Protocol File Let’s start from scratch to create your serial dilution protocol. Open up a new file in your editor and start with the line: from opentrons import protocol_api Throughout this documentation, you’ll see protocols that begin with the import statement shown above. It identifies your code as an Opentrons protocol. This statement is not required, but including it is a good practice and allows most code editors to provide helpful autocomplete suggestions. Everything else in the protocol file is required. Next, you’ll specify the version of the API you’re using. Then comes the core of the protocol: defining a single run() function that provides the'),\n",

For this tutorial, you’ll write very little Python outside of the run() function. But for more complex applications it’s worth remembering that your protocol file is a Python script, so any Python code that can run on your robot can be a part of a protocol. Metadata Every protocol needs to have a metadata dictionary with information about the protocol. At minimum, you need to specify what version of the API the protocol requires. The scripts for this tutorial were validated against API version 2.16, so specify: metadata = {\"apiLevel\": \"2.16\"} You can include any other information you like in the metadata dictionary. The fields protocolName, description, and author are all displayed in the Opentrons App, so it’s a good idea to expand the dictionary to include them: metadata = { \"apiLevel\": \"2.16\", \"protocolName\": \"Serial Dilution Tutorial\", \"description\":'),\n",

The run() function Now it’s time to actually instruct the Flex or OT-2 how to perform serial dilution. All of this information is contained in a single Python function, which has to be named run. This function takes one argument, which is the protocol context. Many examples in these docs use the argument name protocol, and sometimes they specify the argument’s type: def run(protocol: protocol_api.ProtocolContext): With the protocol context argument named and typed, you can start calling methods on protocol to add labware and hardware. Labware For serial dilution, you need to load a tip rack, reservoir, and 96-well plate on the deck of your Flex or OT-2. Loading labware is done with the load_labware() method of the protocol context, which takes two arguments: the standard labware name as defined in the Opentrons Labware'),\n",

Loading a pipette is done with the load_instrument() method, which takes three arguments: the name of the pipette, the mount it’s installed in, and the tip racks it should use when performing transfers. Load whatever pipette you have installed in your robot by using its standard pipette name.

And now you won’t have to reference tips again in your code — it’s assigned to the left_pipette and the robot will know to use it when commanded to pick up tips. You may notice that the value of tip_racks is in brackets, indicating that it’s a list. This serial dilution protocol only uses one tip rack, but some protocols require more tips, so you can assign them to a pipette all at once, like tip_racks=[tips1, tips2].

Move a portion of the combined liquid from column 1 to 2, then from column 2 to 3, and so on all the way to column 12. Thanks to the flexibility of the API’s transfer() method, which combines many building block commands into one call, each of these phases can be accomplished with a single line of code! You’ll just have to write a few more lines of code to repeat the process for as many rows as you want to fill. Let’s start with the diluent.

The first argument is the amount to transfer to each destination, 100 µL. The second argument is the source, column 1 of the reservoir (which is still specified with grid-style coordinates as A1 — a reservoir only has an A row). The third argument is the destination. Here, calling the wells() method of plate returns a list of every well, and the command will apply to all of them. In plain English, you’ve instructed the robot, “For every well on the plate, aspirate 100 µL of fluid from column 1 of the reservoir and dispense it in the well.” That’s how we understand this line of code as scientists, yet the robot will understand and execute it as'),\n",

To do this row by row, nest the commands in a for loop: for i in range(8): row = plate.rows()[i] Using Python’s built-in range class is an easy way to repeat this block 8 times, once for each row. This also lets you use the repeat index i with plate.rows() to keep track of the current row. In each row, you first need to add solution. This will be similar to what you did with the diluent, but putting it only in column 1 of the plate. It’s best to mix the combined solution and diluent thoroughly, so add the optional mix_after argument to transfer(): left_pipette.transfer(100, reservoir[\"A2\"], row[0], mix_after(3, 50)) As before, the first argument specifies to transfer 100 µL.

The fourth argument specifies to mix 3 times with 50 µL of fluid each time. Finally, it’s time to dilute the solution down the row. One approach would be to nest another for loop here, but instead let’s use another feature of the transfer() method, taking lists as the source and destination arguments: left_pipette.transfer(100, row[:11], row[1:], mix_after(3, 50)) There’s some Python shorthand here, so let’s unpack it. You can get a range of indices from a list using the colon : operator, and omitting it at either end means “from the beginning” or “until the end” of the list. So the source is row[:11], from the beginning of the row until its 11th item. And the destination is row[1:], from index 1 (column 2!) until the end. Since both of'),\n",

Since both of these lists have 11 items, transfer() will step through them in parallel, and they’re constructed so when the source is 0, the destination is 1; when the source is 1, the destination is 2; and so on. This condenses all of the subsequent transfers down the row into a single line of code. 8-Channel Pipette If you’re using an 8-channel pipette, you’ll need to make a couple tweaks to the single-channel code from above. Most importantly, whenever you target a well in row A of a plate with an 8-channel pipette, it will move its topmost tip to row A, lining itself up over the entire column. Thus, when adding the diluent, instead of targeting every well on the plate, you should only target the top row: left_pipette.transfer(100, reservoir[\"A1\"], plate.rows()[0]) And by accessing an entire column at'),\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mThe Thermocycler can control its block temperature, including holding at a temperature and adjusting for the volume of liquid held in its loaded plate. Temperature To set the block temperature inside the Thermocycler, use set_block_temperature(). At minimum you have to specify a temperature in degrees Celsius: tc_mod.set_block_temperature(temperature=4) If you don’t specify any other parameters, the Thermocycler will hold this temperature until a new temperature is set, deactivate_block() is called, or the module is powered off. New in version 2.0. Hold Time You can optionally instruct the Thermocycler to hold its block temperature for a specific amount of time. You can specify hold_time_minutes, hold_time_seconds, or both (in which case they will be added together). For example, this will set the block to 4 °C for 4 minutes and 15 seconds: tc_mod.set_block_temperature( temperature=4, hold_time_minutes=4, hold_time_seconds=15) Note Your protocol will not proceed to further commands\n",

Temperature Control The primary function of the module is to control the temperature of its deck, using set_temperature(), which takes one parameter: celsius. For example, to set the Temperature Module to 4 °C: temp_mod.set_temperature(celsius=4) When using set_temperature(), your protocol will wait until the target temperature is reached before proceeding to further commands.

If you don’t specify a hold time, the protocol will proceed as soon as the target temperature is reached. New in version 2.0. Block Max Volume The Thermocycler’s block temperature controller varies its behavior based on the amount of liquid in the wells of its labware. Accurately specifying the liquid volume allows the Thermocycler to more precisely control the temperature of the samples. You should set the block_max_volume parameter to the amount of liquid in the fullest well, measured in µL. If not specified, the Thermocycler will assume samples of 25 µL. It is especially important to specify block_max_volume when holding at a temperature. For example, say you want to hold larger samples at a temperature for a short time: tc_mod.set_block_temperature(\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mTo adjust the temperature of a thermocycler block on the Opentrons OT2 robot, you can use the `set_block_temperature()` method.
